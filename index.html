   <div class="headers aboutme"><h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve always been connected to the cosmos, 
    and had a knowing that there was more to life than the matrix we
    experience.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2003, I wandered into a psychicâ€™s hut on the
    Atlantic City boardwalk. She read me like a book, brought me to 
    tears, then handed me a Rose Quartz to place on my heart, and 
    Hematite for protection. I used these crystals for a short time, 
    then placed them in a box that remained untouched for many years.</p>
    <p>At the end of 2021, my awakening began my healing journey. I 
    educated myself about the universe and all things CRYSTALS! I 
    learned that the best way to receive the benefits of ðŸ’Ž is to 
    wear them! So, I ordered a few bracelets for myself and realized 
    that I wanted to receive all the benefits and therefore wear ALL 
    of the crystalsðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>Soon after my 37th birthday, in April of 2022, I was called to
    create my brand and a month later, the name â€˜Golden Light Designsâ€™ 
    popped into my head. </p>
    <p>GLD was born on 7/17âœ¨</p>

    <p> Each bracelet is made to order by hand and every design has been carefully curated to provide both style and personal benefits for the mind, body and soul. </p>
    
    <p>The beads are all natural, high-grade, tumbled, gemstone crystals and because of this, each bead is unique with varying shade, size and slight inclusions or imperfections. </p>
    
    <p>No bracelet will be exactly the same because of the bracelet size and unique beads but ALL bracelets are created with purpose, love, and the intention of healing and shining one's own light ðŸ’–</p>
